      <p id="how-it-works">
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
        MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.

        YOUR TIME IS PRECIOUS
        Obviously you can pick up a new framework, language or platform on your own. Youâ€™ve done it before.
        You know the drill...
        dissapointed face emoji
        Cobble together hours-long videos, docs, tutorials, and forum posts
        confounded face emoji
        Watch long, unedited videos at 2Ã— speed
        tired face emoji
        Dig through the comments when tutorials give you more bugs than working code
        crying face emoji
        Read blog post after unreliable blog post
        loudly crying face emoji
        Beg for answers on StackOverflow when you hit dead ends
        All the while, your poor computer screams under the weight of all those tabs.
        What about learning from books? Books are great! They're sometimes edited by professionals, which is more than you can say for most tutorials you find. But publishers canâ€™t keep up with the pace of modern web development. You can't keep up either, at least not with your old approach.
        Nobodyâ€™s paying you to find the bugs in their crummy tutorials. You donâ€™t have time to dig your way out of all those rabbit holes for a supposedly free education.
         So youâ€™ve been procrastinating a little. Orâ€¦ a lot.
        Your time is precious. You're a professional.
        THERE HAS TO BE AN EASIER WAY
        Don't you wish you could jack into the Matrix and inject Full Stack Web Development directly to your brain?
        Sounds convenient, but it's not going to happen anytime soon.
        But what if you had the next best thing?
        What if you could simply sit down and start learning? What if you could skip all the searching, the cobbling, the contradictory advice, the bugs, the forums, and the dead ends?
        What if you had on-demand experts available to hand you the best, curated material on modern web development?
        Think how much easier it would be for you to stay on the bleeding edge of our industry. With just 10-30 minutes a day, you'd be able to power through a major topic every week.
        With the right teacher and the right courses, this isn't a pipe dream. Picture yourself months from now, sitting down to a heady programming challenge, and whispering I know wtf I am doing.
        That is what egghead can do for you.
        THERE IS AN EASIER WAY
